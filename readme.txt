== Description ==

*	[Gravity Forms][gravityforms glotpress] 1.9.14

[gravityforms glotpress]: http://glotpress.pronamic.nl/projects/gravityforms
	"Gravity Forms GlotPress project"

> This plugin requires the <a href="https://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms plugin</a>.

> This plugin requires a <a href="http://nl.wordpress.org/">Dutch WordPress installation</a>. Make sure you have `define( 'WPLANG', 'nl_NL' );` in your WordPress `wp-config.php` file. 

The [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) plugin by default only includes
US and international address types. This plugin adds an option for Dutch address notation.


== Installation ==

Extract the ZIP file and move the resulting `wp-gravityforms-nl` directory to the ``/wp-content/plugins/`
directory of your  WordPress installation. Then activate the plugin from the Plugins page in the WordPress admin.
